This script was written to poison the database of an
email phisher.

It pulls data from a .csv file generated by
http://fakenamegenerator.com and feeds the fake data
into the phishers database to poison the data hopefully
ruining the entire database

I encourage you to get your own data from fakenamegenerator.com.
The field order for the CSV is as follows:
GivenName,MiddleInitial,Surname,Gender,StreetAddress,City,State,ZipCode,
EmailAddress,TelephoneNumber,MothersMaiden,Birthday,CCType,CCNumber,CVV2,
CCExpires,NationalID,Username,Password
